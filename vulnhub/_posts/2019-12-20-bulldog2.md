# # Enumeration and Scanning
 #### ** nmap ** scans were able to discover only a web application running on port 80.

>## nmap -sV -sC -oA scan1 192.168.0.135


![nmap-output](https://i.ibb.co/jTqGjJn/bulldog-nmap.png)

*nmap* scan show us  port 80 is open, so we can brows the ip address in the browser.

The main application was developed in AngularJS  _(Find in favicon of the application )_ .it has Login and Register tab on the homepage.After clicking on it **a notice was given on that page stating that they are not accepting registration at this time due to security concerns.**

There was a login tab as well on the Homepage. It is available for sole attack surface.

##  dirb and gobuster 

I decided to look for other files and folders on the target application. for this purpose i used the **dirb** tools.

![source code](https://i.ibb.co/DGW5HBS/durb-screen-short.png)

**dirb** result is not satisfactory and  also try **gobuster** but i returning  "*200 ok*"  to every request .So  decided to browse around and view the source code.

![source code](https://i.ibb.co/drcnKCg/page-source-code.png)

There are some  **javascript** bundled file and decided to look inside code of that file.I decided to start from  **main.8b490782e52b9899e2a7.bundle.js** .

![main js file](https://i.ibb.co/X5gVJbH/source-code.png)

These minified files make analysis a little more difficult than usual, i decided to prettify them with Online JavaScript Beautifier (https://beautifier.io/)

![beautify](https://i.ibb.co/KqY32cG/buitefier-onlein.png)

After that i copy the code in Text-editor and try to analyse  the code and found some interesting point in that code.Registration is close but the **registration function** stile in that code.and some **token id**
 
 ![source code analyse](https://i.ibb.co/fMnTZch/registationlink.png)

![username password](https://i.ibb.co/XDhj83j/reg-username-pass.png)


So we found the registration url ***("/users/register")*** and ***onRegisterSubmit*** function. and also found ***id_token (master_admin_user)*** but don't know what is doing. So i decided to make register on that application with **burp suite**. Capture the login request and send it into the **repeater** and modify the request and send to the server and get back success message on **"User Registered"**

![request modify](https://i.ibb.co/ygPxHNx/reg-uscess.png)

##  Login with New user credentials.
![Login](https://i.ibb.co/44C1w5Y/loginsucess.png)

Using the ***Burp suite*** i was able to figure out that a JWT token was assigned to the logged in user and the privilege levels were ***standard_user***

![login jwt](https://i.ibb.co/QQ8cZc8/jwt-token.png)


In the source code i found ***master_admin_user***, So i decided to edit JWT token and put ***master_admin_user*** auth_level .I search JWT on google and found JWT decoder website and modify the token.

![token](https://i.ibb.co/SP45wLb/jwt-token-encode.png)

After modifying this token i put it into the burp suite and forwarded the request and now i have new tab called 
***Admin***
![request forward](https://i.ibb.co/8mPGFYZ/now-admin.png)


![admin login option](https://i.ibb.co/6PQdXf1/Cheese-Mon-23-Dec19-14-48.png)

## Command injection
Admin tab has another authentication and is possibly asking for admin credentials.There is hints that Link CLI tools.So background it may be a command line tools performing the authentication. So i send request to ***Burp suite*** and modify the password with ***reverse shell***

![revershell](https://i.ibb.co/bFQ3kWr/shell.png)

And make a receiver with ***netcat (nc)*** to capture the connection of the reverse shell and I got the Shell

## Privilege Escalation

I found my ticket to privilege escalation during enumeration of this account.

![Shell](https://i.ibb.co/Mpc2h2b/Screenshot-at-2019-12-23-12-46-29.png)

Since we have write permissions to `/etc/passwd`, let’s change the `root` password to `root`.So to append a new user with id as 0(userid 0 has root privileges), we need to provide a valid password hash in second column. Crypt function in Perl can be used to create password hashes in the compatible format. Crypt function takes the password and its salt as the arguments and returns a single password hash

![password](https://i.ibb.co/ww70ZKH/password.png)

appending new user with password ***1234*** with root privilege.
